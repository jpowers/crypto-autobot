# Autobuy

Ruby gem and rake task to automate scheduled crypto buys on Coinbase Pro.

The easiest way to run this is to deploy it to heroku and setup a scheduler to run the task.

`rake trade`

To make buys in differnet markets set an environment variable with the key as the market product id (replace the '-' with '\_' ) and the value with the amount you'd like to purchase. You must replace the - with \_ since ENVs can't have hyphens. The rake task will replace the \_ with a - for the correct product code.

`ETH_USD=10` will buy $10 worth of ETH

Other environment variables you will need can be seen in .env.example


Profit!!!
